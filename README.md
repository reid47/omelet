# Omelet
A domain-specific language for web development.

Omelet is currently in its (very) early stages. I make no guarantees that this will work correctly for you, if you choose to try it out.

If you do want to test it out, you'll need Node installed. Clone this repo onto your local machine, navigate to the directory, and run `node readfile.js`. It currently reads Omelet code from `other/test_input.omelet` and outputs HTML to `other/test_output.html`.
