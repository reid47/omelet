# Omelet

Omelet is a language for writing web pages and web templates that compiles
into HTML.

This repo is a fork of my original work on Omelet, which can be found in the
repo for the [Toast transpiler](https://github.com/reid47/toast/). This version
of Omelet extends the version supported by Toast in several ways. Note that
this interpreter also drops the transpiler aspects of Toast. The only goal of
this interpreter is to go from Omelet to HTML.
