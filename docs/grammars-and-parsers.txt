WRITING GRAMMARS & PARSERS

All parsers in Toast are generated by PEG.js. This means that they start
out as parsing expression grammars (PEGs), written according to the PEG.js
syntax.

For details on how to write a grammar with PEG.js, check out:
    http://pegjs.org/documentation

All of the grammars are saved in the grammars/ directory. They serve
as fairly readable and certainly detailed descriptions of the parseable
syntax for each of the supported languages (Omelet, Liquid, Dust, HTML).
Note that there is also a grammar for "Omelet2" - this was the syntax
for an earlier version of Omelet that has now been rendered obsolete. It
is kept there purely for reference; we do not even generate a parser
for it.
