NOTES ABOUT IMPORT/INCLUDE/EXTENDS

import
    - should be at the top of a file
    - multiple allowed
    - (import file.oml)
    - parses file.oml, then includes all defs from file.oml in scope of importing file

include
    - allowed anywhere in a file
    - multiple allowed
    - (include file.oml)
    - just copies all contents of file (EXCEPT for defs) into that place
    - should there be a "with" or something - pass in context?
    - **IMPORTANT:** they are evaluated in the context of the including file,
        so all defs must be defined in the including file (anything def'd in
        the included file is eliminated)
